## Dash swapping script
##

The purpose of this particular script is to be able to hot swap dashses using the GPIO of the pi.

It is currently a work in progress.  However, once finished, the idea is to use a switch somewhere in the car
which will be able to use the GPIO to kick off a script on the pi4, which will stop tunerstudio, swap the dash,
fire tunerstudio back up with the alternate dash.  This should allow for someone who wants say a "track mode" dash
or perhaps an "analytics" dash, besides their primary dash to swap it on a whim.

I will update this as more info becomes available.
