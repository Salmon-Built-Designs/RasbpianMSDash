It's worth noting that it's very easy to do this with a raspberry pi 3b.

The processing power seems to be just fine and the supplies you will need are the following:

- Raspberry pi 3b
- 1 lcd (see main readme on where to obtain this)
- 1 driver board (see main readme)
- 1 hdmi cable, and usb cables necessary to connect to your driver board, as well as power the pi 3b
- 1 sd card that'll fit your pi3b (remember, faster is of course, better)
- rasbian OS (you can use the RasbianConfig folder in primary directory for this)
- A copy of tuner studio

Actually setting everything else can be found in the main readme.
